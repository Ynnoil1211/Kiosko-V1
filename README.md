# Personalized Attendance Control Kiosk

This attendance control system is designed to operate through an HTML page that executes a JavaScript script. The kiosk interface allows users to efficiently and intuitively register their attendance.

Functionality:
HTML Interface: The HTML page provides an interactive environment where users can input their information, such as name and attendance date.

JavaScript Control: A JavaScript script manages the system's logic. This script captures the data entered by the user and sends it to the corresponding database.
